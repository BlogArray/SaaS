                Emergency recovery codes can be utilized to log into your account in cases where your device is lost, and two-factor authentication codes cannot be received. If you lose your device and don't have the recovery codes you will lose access to your account.
            </p>
            <p>
                Generating new emergency recovery codes does not change the keys used in authenticator apps. If you wish to change the key
                used in an authenticator app you should <a asp-page="./ResetAuthenticator">reset your authenticator keys.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                When you generate new emergency recovery codes, it is essential to download or copy the new codes.
                <strong>Your old codes will no longer work</strong>.
